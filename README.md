[IBM® Bluemix™](https://www.ng.bluemix.net) is the IBM open cloud platform that provides mobile and web developers access to IBM software for integration, security, transaction, and other key functions, as well as software from business partners.

This repository is used to share my experiences while working on Bluemix platform. Most of my applications were writen in NodeJS and Python.
